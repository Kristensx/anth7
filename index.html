His father, Richard Pratt, was a magnate in the manufacturing industry, and also the president of Carlton Football Club, and his mother, Jeanne Pratt AC, was a philanthropist. In 2015, BRW Rich 200 accesses his family net worth for A$10.8 billion, making them the second wealthiest family in the country. Forbes Asia assessed the net worth of Anthony alone for US$ 3.5 billion, enlisting him among the 50 wealthiest people in Australia.<br><br>
Pratt completed his Bachelor of Economics honors degree in 1983 from Monash University, after which he joined McKinsey & Co, a consulting firm. After that, he became the joint general manager in the Visy Board of Visy.
